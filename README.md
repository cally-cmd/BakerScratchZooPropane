## Title

The title of our game is `Harley Bakes Dessert`!

## Intent

Our intent for making this game is to further improve on the skills that we have been developing in the first and second games while also adding additional functionality, complexity, and aestheticism. We intend to have a fully realized game with necessary menus, looks, sounds, and length.

## Narrative

You are playing as the world famous baker Harley as you navigate through the cabinets to collect the ingredients and utensils necessary to bake the perfect dessert! Collecting the utensils provides Harley with a boost in confidence because Harley is so confident and comfortable with their work and allows Harley to perform super-human feats!

## Mechanics

To move the baker sprite through the levels use AD for left/right movement and SPACE to jump. When the powerups have been collected there are additional controls like E to dash left/right and W to perform a super jump. Collect all the ingredients and utensils to win!

## Aesthetics

We chose a tilemap that would emulate the feeling that the player was in a kitchen, and chose a background from this as well. We matched the color of the dialog box with the color of the tiles in the background and tried to match the kitchen background to the kitchen tileset as best as possible. We chose a font family that would look good in a restaurant.

## Joys and Struggles

This biggest joys will always be when something performs as we expect it to! And this occurs mostly with the objects that we are already occustomed to using like the particle system, the tilemap, the prefabs, and triggers. This project felt much the same way. There were some strong struggles though! Finding a suitable set of backgrounds to do a parallax background was insanely difficult because our game makes the player navigate both vertically and horizontally, and programming the mechanism to change the scenes was also incredibly tedious and hard-fought.

## Contributions

I was responsible for finding/creating the aesthetics in the game aside from the tilemap which Ethan found. I set up most of the prefabs and created the layout for most of the scenes. Ethan created the animation and set up the code to make the sprite move and have the camera follow and transition between scenes. I added the collectible functionality, and Ethan added the parallax functionality.
